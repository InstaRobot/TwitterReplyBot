#### NOTE: You will need to create a Twitter Developer account and create an API Key/Secret in order to use this software.

## Overview

This is a modular Twitter reply bot written in Swift.

At a high-level, that means you create `Module`s consisting of a single function that return an output string for some input Tweet:

`func output(for reply: Reply, _ completion: @escaping ((String) -> Void))`

The `Bot` then calls its module's `output` method anytime it detects a new Tweet and automatically posts a reply (from the bot) with the string it received.

## Background

This project was motivated by a contest I've been running on Twitter called `Codebreaker`:
https://github.com/JUSTINMKAUFMAN/TwitterCodebreaker

The idea is to have a bot monitor a Tweet (or an account more generally) and process all replies into a coded response from the bot. Users then compete to be first to figure out the bot's encryption algorithm.

The modules I have included in this app as examples are from the first two rounds of that contest.

## Installation

Option 1: Clone this repository and build the app with Xcode 11.3.
Option 2: Download the latest built binary from releases, unzip, and run.

## Getting Started

1. Run the app and enter your Twitter API Key/Secret in the input fields at the bottom of the window
2. Click `Update`
3. Send a tweet to the bot and watch it reply!
4. Add your own `Module`

## Credit

In order to authorize and communicate with the Twitter API, this app copies and modifies source from the excellent [Swifter]( https://github.com/mattdonnelly/Swifter) library by Matt Donnelly. In the future - and assuming there is interest in this project - I will probably try to fork the Swifter library properly; this was just easier when I wasn't sure where the project was going.
